   USER STORY

  As a user, I want to see all students displayed on a chart.
  There should be check boxes next to each students name.
  If the student is unchecked, their background should appear red.
  If the student is checked, their background should appear green.

  There should be an "add notes" button for each student, and clicking that button opens up a text field.
  There should be a save button that gets rid of the box, and adds the text to a notes area.
  If there is a note, there should be an edit note button instead of an add note button.
