  There should be check boxes next to each students name.   DONE
  If the student is unchecked, their background should appear red. DONE
  If the student is checked, their background should appear green. DONE

  There should be an "add notes" button for each student, and clicking that button opens up a text field. DONE
  There should be a save button that gets rid of the box, and adds the text to a notes area. DOONE
  If there is a note, there should be an edit note button instead of an add note button. DONE
