   USER STORY

  As a user, I want to see all students displayed on a chart. <br>
  There should be check boxes next to each students name. <br>
  If the student is unchecked, their background should appear red. <br>
  If the student is checked, their background should appear green. <br>

  There should be an "add notes" button for each student, and clicking that button opens up a text field. <br>
  There should be a save button that gets rid of the box, and adds the text to a notes area. <br>
  If there is a note, there should be an edit note button instead of an add note button. <br>
  
  Extra Credit:
  
  When I click on the "Add Student" button, a form should appear above the button, and the button's text should change to "Save". <br>
  When I click "Save", the student should be added to the list. <br>
